final
The final statement has a different meaning depending on its context.
* When applied to a variable (primitive): The value of the variable cannot change.
* When applied to a variable (reference): The reference variable cannot point to any other object on the heap.
* When applied to a method: The method cannot be overridden.
* When applied to a class: The class cannot be subclassed.

finally keyword
There is an optional finally block after the try block or after the catch block.
Statements in the finally block will always be executed, even if an exception is thrown (except if the Java Virtual
Machine exits from the try block).
The finally block is often used to write the clean-up code.
It will be executed after the try and catch blocks, but before control transfers back to its origin.

finalize()
The automatic garbage collector calls the finalize() method just before actually destroying the object.
A class can therefore override the finalize() method from the Object class in order to define custom behavior
during garbage collection.
