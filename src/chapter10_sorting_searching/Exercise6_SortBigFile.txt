To sort a 20 GB file with one string per line I would use external sort:
The file would be divided into chunks of x megabytes each, where x is the amount of memory available.
Each chunk would be sorted separately and saved back to the file system.
Once all the chunks were sorted, they would be merged, one by one.
At the end, we would have a fully sorted file.
