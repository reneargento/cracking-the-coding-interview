To test an ATM I would start by asking questions to understand the scenario:
1- Who is going to use the ATM (anyone, blind people or other specific group of people).
2- For what objective (withdrawing money, transferring money, checking the account balance, or something else).
3- What tools are available to test? Do we have access to the code, or just to the ATM?

I would then break down the problem into different testable components.
These components include:
1- Logging in
2- Withdrawing money
3- Depositing money
4- Checking balance
5- Transferring money

A mix of manual and automated testing would be used.
Manual testing would involve going through the steps above, making sure to check for all the error cases (low balance,
new account, nonexistent account, and so on).
Automated testing would involve automating all the above standard scenarios and also looking for specific issues, such as
race conditions. Ideally, a closed system would be set up with fake accounts and it would be ensured that, even if
someone withdraws and deposits money rapidly from different locations, the person never gets money or loses money that
she shouldn't.

Above all, security and reliability would be prioritized. People's account must always be protected, and money should
always be properly accounted for.
It would also be checked that there is no way to insert some device to try to steal people's credit cards and that there
is no way to retrieve money from the ATM illegally.
