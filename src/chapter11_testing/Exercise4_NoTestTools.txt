To load test a webpage I would start with identifying the performance critical scenarios and the metrics which fulfills
the performance objectives. Typical criteria include:
* Response time
* Throughput
* Resource utilization
* Maximum load that the system can bear

Then, tests would be designed to simulate the load, taking care to measure each of these criteria.

Concurrent users would be simulated by creating thousands of virtual users.
A multi-threaded program with thousands of threads would be used, where each thread acts as a real-world user loading the page.
For each user, the response time, data I/O, etc., would be programmatically measured.

The results would then be analyzed based on the data gathered during the tests and compared with the accepted values.
