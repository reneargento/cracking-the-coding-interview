To test a pen I would start by asking questions to understand the scenario:
1- Who is going to use the pen (adults, children, or some other specific group).
2- For what objective (writing, drawing, coloring or something else).
3- Where the pen is going to be used on (paper, clothing, walls).
4- What kind of tip the pen has (felt, ballpoint).
5- Is the ink intended to wash off or is it intended to be permanent.
6- What color is the ink supposed to be?
7- What is the length and width of the pen supposed to be?

I would then design the test cases and verify if the pen holds up under these conditions:
1- Fact check: verify if the pen has the expected tip and that the ink is one of the allowed colors.
2- Fact check: verify if the pen has the expected length and width.
3- Intended use: does the pen achieve its objective (does it write, draw or color properly) in the place it is supposed to be used?
4- Intended use (in the case that the ink is not intended to be permanent): does the ink washes off of the place it is
supposed to be used (even if it has been there for an extended period of time)? Does it wash off in hot, warm and cold water?
5- Safety (in the case children are going to use the pen): is the pen safe (non-toxic) for children?
6- Unintended uses: how else might the target audience use the pen? They might write on other surfaces, so it should be checked
whether the behavior there is correct. They might also stomp on the pen, throw it, and so on.
