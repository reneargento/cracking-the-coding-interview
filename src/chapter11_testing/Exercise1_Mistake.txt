There are two mistakes in the code:

#1: The variable "i" is an unsigned int, so its value will never go below zero.
When the for loop tries to decrement it below zero, it will wrap to its maximum value.
This will lead to an infinite loop.
To fix this, the for loop condition should be "i > 0" and an extra instruction should be added after the for loop to print
the 0 value.

#2: Since "i" is an unsigned int, the parameter to printf() should be "%u" instead of "%d".
