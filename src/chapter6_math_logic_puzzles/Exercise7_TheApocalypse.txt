The gender ratio of the new population can be computed as follows:
Different groups of families will have sequences of children such as:
G
BG
BBG
BBBG
and so on, where B means a boy and G means a girl.

If we add all the sequences into one string S (which represents the total population), we will see that every newborn child added to S has
50% chance of being a boy and 50% chance of being a girl.
This means that the gender ratio of the new population will still be 50% girls and 50% boys.
