To figure out the poisoned bottle in as few days as possible, each bottle id could be mapped to the 10 test strips in a unique way.
This can be done by mapping each bottle id to the test strips by its binary representation.
Bits with value 1 in the binary representation of the bottle would mean putting a drop in the equivalent test strip.
Nothing is done when bits have value 0.

After applying the drops on the test strips, the unique combination of positive test strips would identify the poisoned bottle.
It would be the bottle whose id has the equivalent binary representation.
This approach would identify the poisoned bottle in 7 days.
